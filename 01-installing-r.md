About R
=======

-   R is a programming language that is commonly used for statistical
    analyses and plotting.
-   R was created more than 30 years ago, publicly announced in 1993, by
    Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman – it’s first public version is only
    3 years younger than Python.
-   Originally, R was developed as a version (or “dialect”) of the
    statistical environment language called “S,” developed by John
    Chambers et al. at Bell Labs in the 1970s.
-   The design focus of R is centered around and targeted at the user
    rather than the programmer – primarily, it aims to equip the user
    with tools for statistical analyses; however, it also allows users
    to program custom functionality if necessary.
-   Being a Python and C programmer, I personally see R more as an
    environment for statistical analysis (versus application
    development), whereas Python is more of a general purpose language.
-   While Python is becoming more and more popular in various scientific
    computing-related fields (especially machine learning and deep
    learning), R is still a widely used language in data science. This
    is likely because there are many R libraries and packages for
    statistical computing and analysis that are not available through
    Python (yet).
-   Similar to Python and other languages, R is open source and free to
    use.
-   Since web-searching R can be a bit difficult using just that one
    letter, we usually refer to “R” as “R lang” in such contexts.

Installing R
============

-   R, and various additional R packages we are using, are available
    from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).
-   Since any external installation guides may become obsolete rather
    sooner than later, I recommend visiting
    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org</a>
    and following the official installation tutorials on there.
-   When you visit
    <a href="https://cran.r-project.org" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org</a>,
    you will find installation guides for all major operating systems:
    Linux, macOS, and Windows.
-   If you are using macOS or Linux, you can double-check your
    installation by executing “R” in the command line terminal:

-   Note that if you share analyses or ask questions about certain
    behaviors or bugs in R, I highly recommend including the output of
    the `sessionInfo()` command, which prints some basic information
    about your environment:

Installing RStudio
==================

-   While the default R package should provide you with all the
    computing capabilities you need, the RStudio integrated development
    environment (IDE) may provide you with a more user-friendly
    interface to R – you can think of it as a fancy text editor for
    writing your code.
-   Caution: You need to install R first before you can install R
    Studio.
-   What makes RStudio particularly useful is that it provides you with
    a graphical user interface that not only allows you to write code
    but also lets you run code and view plots side-by-side, which some
    people prefer.
-   The RStudio IDE is developed but the RStudio company, however, they
    offer a free basic version that you can install on a laptop or
    desktop computer. The download page and instructions are available
    at
    <a href="https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/" class="uri">https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/</a>.

-   One of my favorite features of RStudio is working with R Notebook,
    since it allows interleaving Markdown text (for note taking), R
    code, and plots. To open a new R Notebook, click on “New File” in
    the upper left corner and select “R Notebook.” (When you open an R
    Notebook for the first time, click “Yes” when it prompts you to
    install the required packages.)

-   Clicking on the previous button will render a nice version of this
    notebook that you can later share with others:

files in this GitHub repository are itself RStucdio R Markdown (.Rmd)
files. To find out more about hosting R Markdown files on GitHub, please

(Optional) Linking RStudio and GitHub
=====================================

-   Open RStudio; then, click on `Tools` in the menu bar; select
    “Git/SVN” from the menu on the left.
-   In the Git/SVN menu, make sure that “Enable version control
    interface for RStudio projects is checked” doublecheck that the link
    to the “Git executable” is correct:

-   Next, click on “Create RSA key” and confirm the next menu with
    “Create.” The passphrase is optional.

-   Then, click “View puplic key” and copy that key to your clipboard.
    We are going to enter it on GitHub next.

-   Go to your GItHub account, open the settings, and click on “SSH and
    GPG keys”. In the menu to the right, click on “New SSH key” and
    paste in the copied key.
-   Now, the next time you create a “New Project” in RStudio, you can
    use the “Git” option to link an existing repository from your GitHub
    account.

Installing R Packages
=====================

-   Additional, usually more specialized functions that are not included
    in the basic installation of R.
-   The two main repositories where you can find R packages are CRAN
    (<a href="https://cran.r-project.org" class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org</a>)
    and GitHub
    (<a href="https://github.com" class="uri">https://github.com</a>).
-   To install packages from CRAN, you can either.
    -   Click on Tools -&gt; Install Packages … in RStudio.
    -   Install a packages from the console/terminal. For example, to
        install the package feather, execute
        `install.packages("feather")`.
-   To use a package after installing it, we need to load it in our
    current R session. To do so, use the library function, e.g.,
    `library(feather)`.
-   To update packages, you can use `update.packages()` to update all
    packages. Or, run `install.packages("feather")` to update a specific
    package.
-   Use the `help` function to get more information about a package. For
    example, `help(package = "feather")`.
